For project part A - J except part C, run 219project1p1 using Jupyter
For part C, run tiff.ipynb using Jupiter. 

For the first file (219project1p1), in order to save running time, the user can choose which
part to run by setting PART_A through PART_J as True. And the user needs to change min_dfs at 
the very beginning of the program as well. 
For Part E, user needs to change the pipeline manually for LSI and NMF tasks
For Part F, user needs to change the pipeline manually for LSI and NMF tasks
For Part G, user needs to manually change the class_prior to change the threshold
For Part H, user needs to manually change the class_weight and the pipelines for different tasks
For Part I, user needs to manually change the penalty as 'l1' or 'l2' and change the pipelines
for LSI and NMF tasks
For the rest part, the program can automatically present all the results. 

For the second file, user just needs to run the program to get all the results for 10 most significant terms per class.
